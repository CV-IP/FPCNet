# FPCNet
Fully Point-wise Convolutional Neural Network[1]


## Installation
    install caffe master and compile matlab interface

## Folder Structure
    Root
        -data
            Folder containing hazy images
        -models
    	    caffelmodel and deploy file of the FPCNet_DH
	    -results
		    Folder containing dehazed results
	    -utils
		    -fast-guided-filter
			    fast guided filter code[2]
		    -index
			    psnr and ssim code[3]
	    -testDemoFPCNet_DH.m
	    	main body of the demo script
## Quick Start
    testDemoFPCNet_DH.m
        -configure the following variables, 
            -"MatCaffeRoot":, path to the matlab interface of caffe
            -"gpu_mode"ï¼›1 for gpu and 0 for cpu
    
    run testDemoFPCNet_DH.m
    
    *you'll get the dehazed results in "./results/"
    
    *The codes have been tested based on the Matlab Interface of CAFFE, which is compiled with Cuda8.0 and Cudnn v5 and Ubuntu 16.04.
